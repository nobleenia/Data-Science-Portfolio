# Nigerian Movie Data
## Introduction
The Nigerian Movie Data is a data analysis project that explores the Nigerian film industry's trends and preferences. The project involves data cleaning, data visualization, and insights into the Nigerian movie industry's historical data. This README provides an overview of the project's code, data cleaning, visualization, and conclusions.

## Code Overview
Importing Libraries
The project begins by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Data Loading
Data is loaded from an IMDb dataset containing information about Nigerian movies. The dataset includes various attributes such as movie titles, directors, actors, genres, release dates, and more.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves selecting specific columns of interest, removing rows with missing values, and saving the cleaned data to a new file. This step ensures that the dataset is ready for further analysis.

## Deep Cleaning
Further data cleaning is performed to refine the dataset. This includes removing curly braces and quotes from specific columns, converting release dates to just the year, and splitting the "stars" column into multiple columns.

## Data Visualization
Data is visualized in two ways:

### Movies by Year:
The number of movies released in each year is visualized using a bar chart. This visualization highlights the growth of the Nigerian film industry over the years.

### Movies by Genre:
The distribution of movies by genre is visualized, showing the most popular genres in Nigerian cinema.

## Conclusion
The data analysis reveals the following insights:  
The Nigerian film industry has witnessed significant growth over the years, with a substantial increase in movie production from the 1990s onwards.  
"Drama" is the dominant genre in Nigerian cinema, with "Comedy" as the second most popular genre.  
The industry caters to a diverse range of genres, reflecting the audience's varied tastes and preferences.  
While some genres are well-established, others, such as "Biography," "Sci-Fi," and "War," have fewer representations in the dataset.  

The Nigerian Movie Data project provides valuable insights into the Nigerian film industry's historical data, shedding light on trends and preferences that can inform future movie production and recommendations.
