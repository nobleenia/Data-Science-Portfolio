# Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Prediction Using TensorFlow
## Project Overview
This project aims to build and train machine learning models for predicting age, gender, and ethnicity based on facial images using TensorFlow and Python.

Data was collected from Kaggle.
Data preprocessing included resizing and normalizing the images.
A CNN model was built for regression to predict age.
The model architecture included Conv2D layers, Batch Normalization, MaxPooling, Dense layers, and Dropout.

## Models and Methods
### Gender Prediction Model
#### Objective:
The objective of the gender prediction model is to classify facial images into two categories: male and female.

#### Methods:

Basic data preprocessing was performed, which included resizing and normalizing the facial images.
A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was built for image classification.
The model architecture includes Conv2D layers, Batch Normalization, MaxPooling, Dense layers, and Dropout.
Binary cross-entropy loss was used as the loss function.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the optimizer.
Training was stopped when the validation loss reached 0.2700.

### Ethnicity Prediction Model
#### Objective:
The objective of the ethnicity prediction model is to classify facial images into different ethnicity categories.

#### Methods:

Sparse categorical cross-entropy loss was used as the loss function.
RMSprop was used as the optimizer.
Training was stopped when the validation accuracy reached 79%.

### Age Prediction Model
#### Objective:
The objective of the age prediction model is to predict the age of a person from their facial image.

#### Methods:

Mean squared error loss was used as the loss function.
Adam optimizer was used.
Training was stopped when the validation loss reached 110.
Data
The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle, and it includes facial images for age, gender, and ethnicity prediction. The data was preprocessed as mentioned in the methods for each model.

## Requirements
The code for each model requires the following libraries and packages:

TensorFlow
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Plotly
Ensure you have these libraries installed to run the code successfully.

## Usage
This project can be used for various applications, including facial recognition, demographic analysis, and age estimation. To use the project, you can follow these steps:

Download and preprocess the dataset as described in the code.
Train the desired model (gender, ethnicity, or age prediction) based on your requirements.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy or mean squared error.
Use the trained model to make predictions on new facial images.
